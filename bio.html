          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p> Hi, I'm India, a Junior Front-End Software Engineer with a background in Fashion CAD Design. I am passionate about combining my artistic and technical skills to create visually appealing and user-friendly digital experiences. With a solid foundation in both design and development, I bring a unique perspective to the front-end development process. 
           

  <p>          
My background in Fashion CAD Design has taught me the importance of attention to detail, creativity, and the ability to think outside the box. As a Junior Front-End Engineer, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and have a strong understanding of responsive design and accessibility best practices. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve the user experience and am eager to continue learning and growing in the field.
</p>

I am a hard-working, driven individual who is committed to delivering high-quality work. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to showcase my skills and bring my creative vision to life.
          </p>
